                        <ul>
                            <li> When a tree reaches to 70% of its average life span or either it has degraded to a level where a new tree/plan on the same field can provide more environmental benefits in terms of oxygen production, temperature control or soil conservation etc. An example – Azadirachta indica (neem) tree can reach up to an age of 120 years. So, the life term for such tree will be considered as 84 years.
                            </li>
                            <li> If for some unfortunate reason a tree do not grow well, collapse, get uprooted, damaged completely due to some natural calamities, such case will be considered as end of life term for that tree.
                            </li>
