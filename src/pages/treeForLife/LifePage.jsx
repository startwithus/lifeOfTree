                    <h1>What is the challenge?</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>High deforestation rates worldwide.</li>
                        <li>Each day at least 80,000 acres (32,300 ha) of forest disappear from Earth. At least another 80,000 acres (32,300 ha) of forest are degraded.</li>
                        <li>As per a recent study world’s rain forests could completely vanish next hundred years with current rate of deforestation!</li>
                        <li>Researches from past 50 years show that forest/tree to human ratio is going down day by day; degrading at a higher rate and equilibrium is in danger zone now.</li>
                        <li>The good news is that we still have some control in hand and the best thing is that we can do it since forest/trees can be renewed in limited time unlike the other natural resources, provided we wake up early and start our efforts today with an approach and commitment.</li>
                    </ul>
